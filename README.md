Game of Life: Gotham Edition

📜 Overview
This project is an iOS implementation of Conway’s Game of Life, created as part of my iOS software development class, where I received the highest grade. The Gotham Edition brings a dark, thematic twist to the classic cellular automaton, featuring a sleek UI inspired by Gotham.

🚀 Features
Custom Gotham-Themed UI 🦇
Swift-Based Implementation 📱
Dynamic Grid Generation 🔲
Interactive Gameplay Controls 🎮
Performance Optimized Using Swift Algorithms ⚡
🛠️ Technologies Used
Swift (UIKit / SwiftUI)
Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
Core Animation for smooth cell transitions


🎮 How to Play
Launch the app to see a randomly generated grid of cells.
Start the simulation, and watch the cells evolve based on Conway’s rules:
A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors dies.
A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
Pause and edit the grid by adding or removing cells.
Restart with a fresh grid for a new experience!
